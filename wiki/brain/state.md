# Brain — state

Where the brain itself was, is, and wants to be. `/capture brain`
routes brain-self observations (workflow gaps, schema rough edges)
into the sections below.

## Cross-level context

*(none yet)*

## Past

- **2026-07-10** — kernel extracted as a standalone, client-agnostic
  shell: schema, tools, skills, personas, UI, CI, tests; content
  layers start empty.

## Now

- Empty shell awaiting an organisation's content. `brain.config.yml`
  declares no active repos yet.
- Every scheduled operation degrades to a clean no-op on the empty
  shell; the state-refresh ops (`security-scan`, `issues-pull`)
  bootstrap their repo maps from `brain.config.yml` on first run.
- `reflection-check internal-refs` enforces the standalone
  guarantee: every repo-path reference in the kernel surface must
  resolve inside the repo.
- Deadline tracking is generic: `wiki/_state/deadlines.json` holds
  named dates (compliance, renewals, launches); the weekly
  `deadline-countdown` op refreshes days-left.

## Perceived

*(no Now-vs-Perceived gaps recorded yet)*

## Target

- Adopt for a project: fill `brain.config.yml`, author team/user
  personas, run the first `/in` ingest.

## Open threads

*(none yet — `/capture brain` appends here)*
