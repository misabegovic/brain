# Ask — single entry for querying the brain

You are working in `~/projects/brain`. There are four read-side
operations underneath this one skill — `wiki-query`, `wiki-plan`,
`wiki-overlap`, `wiki-coverage`. This skill picks the right one based
on the phrasing of the question.

## Routing

Default is `wiki-query` (factual lookup). Promote to a more specific
skill when the phrasing matches:

| Phrasing cue                                              | Skill          |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| "plan", "outline the work", "what do I need for X", "how should I approach X" | `wiki-plan`    |
| "overlap", "duplicate", "stepping on", "anyone else doing X", "is anything similar in flight" | `wiki-overlap` |
| "coverage", "what's missing in repo X", "how much do we know about repo X", "what isn't documented in X" | `wiki-coverage`|
| "what is", "where is", "why did we", "have we discussed", "show me", anything else factual | `wiki-query` (default) |

A question can legitimately span multiple skills (e.g. "plan a refactor
of the candidate scoring system — is anyone else working on it?"). In
that case run them in order: `wiki-plan` first, then `wiki-overlap` as
part of step 4 of the plan protocol. Don't fork into parallel skills;
chain them.

## Overrides

The user can force a route with a leading marker:

- `query: <question>` — factual lookup, even if phrasing sounds like a plan.
- `plan: <task>` — go straight to `wiki-plan`.
- `overlap: <topic>` — go straight to `wiki-overlap`.
- `coverage: <repo>` — go straight to `wiki-coverage`.

## Announce before acting

Before running, state in one sentence which skill(s) you're picking
and why. Example:

> "Reading this as a coverage question on `infrastructure` — running wiki-coverage."

If you're chaining (plan → overlap), say so.

## Then

Hand off to the chosen skill and follow its full protocol. This skill
is just the dispatcher.

`wiki-query` and `wiki-plan` don't write to the wiki by default;
`wiki-overlap` writes overlap pages; `wiki-coverage` may append to a
reference page. Each underlying skill's done-check applies as written.

## Done check

- [ ] Routing decision was announced.
- [ ] Underlying skill ran its full protocol.
- [ ] If two skills chained, both produced their expected output.
